# Project context

This repository is a starter template for a greenfield Java project used in an introductory software engineering course in an undergraduate computer science program. Students use it as the starting point for their own projects.

# Default user context

Unless the user says otherwise, assume that you are assisting a student working on a project in this repository. If the user identifies themselves as an instructor or another project stakeholder, adapt your response to that role.

# Student profile

* Prior knowledge: Basic Java and OOP concepts.
* Level of programming experience: Intermediate
* IDE and level of expertise: Intermediate

# Guidance for interacting with users

* Explain the rationale for significant actions: what you did and why.
* Keep explanations brief but instructive, supporting learning through responsible use of AI. For example:

  * When suggesting a Git command, briefly explain what it does.
  * Add explanatory Javadoc comments to all classes and to nontrivial methods and fields when their purpose or behavior is not obvious.
  * Make generated code as self-explanatory as possible, and include explanatory comments where they improve understanding.
  * When faced with a design choice, choose the simplest option that is sufficient for the requirements, while briefly explaining relevant more advanced alternatives.

# Project-specific requirements

## Java version:

Ensure that Java 25 is used when running the application or build tasks. On macOS, use `sdk use java 25.0.3.fx-zulu` to switch to Java 25 if needed.

## Java switch statement style

Use arrow-form switch statements or switch expressions when appropriate:

```java
switch (condition) {
    case ABC -> method("1");
    case DEF -> method("2");
    default -> method("0");
}
```

Indent `case` and `default` one level inside the `switch`, and indent their statements one additional level. For traditional colon-form switches, include `break;` at the end of every case, including `default`, whenever the case can reach it. If a case intentionally falls through without a break, add an explicit `// Fallthrough` comment before the next case.

## SE-EDU Java coding standard

All Java code in this project must follow the project-specific
`seedu-java-coding-standard` skill, based on the
[SE-EDU Java coding standard](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/java/intermediate.html).
This includes naming, four-space indentation, K&R braces, the 120-character
line limit, consistent explicit imports, braced control-flow bodies, and
descriptive Javadoc comments. Apply the standard to production and test code
while preserving behavior and avoiding unrelated formatting changes.

## Git

Use lightweight tags unless the user requests an annotated tag.
When proposing or creating a commit message, include enough detail to explain the rationale for the change.
Do not commit or push unless explicitly asked.

## JUnit test coverage

Aim to cover approximately the highest-value 50% of methods with JUnit tests, prioritizing complex, core, or business-critical logic over trivial wrappers.
After every code change, review and update the relevant JUnit tests so that they continue to cover the highest-value methods and comply with this 50% target.

## UI testing after code updates

After every code update, review `test/ui-test-plan.md` and update it when the change adds or changes observable command-line UI behavior. Then invoke the project-local `$test-ui` skill using the updated plan, even when no plan changes are needed. Treat the test session as part of the code update: report its console transcript and stop at the first failure. Do not claim the code update is complete without reporting the test result or any setup blocker.
